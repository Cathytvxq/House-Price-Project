# House-Price-Project
This is a data-analysis project by myself
This project has three parts: Crawling, Price prediction and Data Visualization
For the Crawling Part, Pool concept is used.
For the Price prediction, R is the language used.
For the Data Visualization, D3.js is used

Click this url (http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Cathytvxq/House-Price-Project/blob/master/Visulization/SHMap.html), the price visualization will be shown. The deeper the background color of the district, the higher the average price of this district. The deeper the dot color, the higher the community price.
